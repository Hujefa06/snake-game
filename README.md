🐍 Project Title:
Console-Based Snake Game in C with High Score Tracking

📄 Abstract:
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake game using C programming for the Windows console. The game features a dynamic snake that grows in length as it consumes randomly placed balls (food) within a bounded grid. It includes:

📌 Features
- Real-time keyboard input using conio.h
- Console graphics with windows.h for cursor control
- Persistent high score tracking via file I/O
- Collision detection with walls and self
- Tail-following mechanics for realistic movement
The game runs in a loop until the player quits or the snake collides with a wall or itself. It provides a nostalgic gaming experience and demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, file handling, and game logic.
- smooth snake movement and score tracking.
- WASD and arrow key controls.
